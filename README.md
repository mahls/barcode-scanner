# 🐢 Barcode Scanner App

This is a simple barcode scanner app built with React Native and Expo. It uses the device camera to scan and decode barcodes or QR codes in real time. The app is cross-platform and easy to run on both iOS and Android using Expo. Just install dependencies, start the Expo server, and scan with the Expo Go app to get started.
